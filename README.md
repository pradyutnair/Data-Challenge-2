# ARIMA Model
The final chosen model for this project is SARIMAX (1,0,1)(1,0,1,12)

## Phase 1 
Conduct univariate time series analysis. This means using only the total crimes to predict the total crimes.

## Phase 2
Use different combinations of features to test feature importance and how it affects model predictions. This has been conducted in the `Test Models.ipynb`.

## Phase 3
Use all the findings and results to construct a SARIMA model with the optimal combination of hyperparameters and test the fit. Evaluate and benchmark the model using evaluation metrics. Also produce forecasts for future values and determine whether the results are reasonable.
